### Number Guessing Game App

#### Overview
A fun and interactive mobile app built with React Native, where users input a number between 1 and 99, and the app tries to guess it. Users provide feedback on whether the guess is higher or lower until the app guesses correctly. The game concludes with a display of the total number of guesses and a log of all attempts.
